# next-contentlayer-clerk

This repo is an example for an issue regarding using Contentlayer along with Clerk in a Next.js 13 web application.

## The issue

It seems to be happening when using `<ClerkProvider>` and `withContentlayer` together. Removing either one of those seems to be making the web application work fine.
